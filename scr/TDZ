// ReferenceError: Cannot access 'theme' before initialization

// This is due to the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

// variables declared with const are in the TDZ and not accessible until their declaration is fully evaluated.

// theme is declared in line 2 therefore any access to it before that line throws an error Message
