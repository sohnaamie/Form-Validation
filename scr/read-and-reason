function test() {
  console.log(value); // Line ①
  if (true) {
    var value = 42;
  }
  console.log(value); // Line ②
 }
 test();

// what happens in the console:

 undefined
 42
 
//  why does this happen?
// JavaScript hoists var declarations to the top of their function scope, but not the assignment.

// In line 1 the value exist but it has not been assigned yet hence the console prints undefined and not an error.

// In line 2  the value has been set to 42 thus the console prints 42.
